## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip
- git

### Installation

1. Fork and clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/file-diff-analyzer.git
cd file-diff-analyzer
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install in development mode:
```bash

## Code Style

### Python Style Guide

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

- Line length: 88 characters (Black default)
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Use docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Follow Google docstring style

### Code Formatting

We use Black for code formatting:

```bash
make format
# or
black src/ tests/
```

### Linting

We use flake8 and mypy for code quality:

```bash
make lint
# or
flake8 src/ tests/
mypy src/
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run with coverage
make test-cov

# Run specific test files
pytest tests/test_analyzer.py

# Run specific test functions
pytest tests/test_analyzer.py::TestFileDiffAnalyzer::test_initialization
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Use fixtures for common test data
- Aim for high test coverage
- Test both success and failure cases

```python
def test_function_name():
    """Test description"""
    # Arrange
