```

### Usage Examples
```python
from file_diff_analyzer import FileDiffAnalyzer, UniversalFileDiffAnalyzer

# Basic analysis
analyzer = FileDiffAnalyzer()
analyzer.add_file("file1.txt")
analyzer.add_file("file2.txt")
result = analyzer.analyze()

# Universal analysis
universal = UniversalFileDiffAnalyzer()
universal.add_file("file1.txt")
universal.add_file("file2.txt")
result = universal.universal_analyze()
```

## Version History

- **1.0.0** - Initial release with full feature set
- **Unreleased** - Development and planning phase

## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0
This is the initial release of the File Difference Analyzer library. It provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing differences between files of various formats with intelligent change detection and configurable analysis parameters.

The library is designed to be:
- **Universal**: Works with any file type without hardcoded patterns
- **Efficient**: O(n) complexity for individual file processing
- **Configurable**: Customizable tolerance thresholds and analysis options
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new file formats and analysis types
- **Well-tested**: Comprehensive test suite with high coverage
- **Well-documented**: Complete API reference and usage examples

### Future Plans
- Support for more file formats (RTF, ODT, etc.)
- Binary file comparison capabilities
- Image-based document analysis
- Cloud storage integration
- Web interface
- Machine learning-based change classification
- Performance optimizations for very large files
